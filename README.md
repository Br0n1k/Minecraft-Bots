# Minecraft-Bots  
fishing.py:  
The main bot is for fishing now, because it's works fine.  
Just start, alt-tab on Minecraft and press RMB for start fishing, mouse cursor must be under the bobber by about ~100 pixels.  
Only windowed mode!  
Should be good lighting and no red things in front of you.  
Bot will do fishing for you up to 1hour (limited for debug now).  
Press and hold TAB for stop and close the application.  
  
mining.py:  
This bot is not functioning properly, still in development now (bad lava detection, need to change the algorithm).  
Key bindings for it:  
press v to start mine  
press c to pause mode  
press TAB for stop
